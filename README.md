# To-Do List Project

This To-Do List project is part of The Odin Project curriculum. It is designed to help users manage their tasks and projects effectively, with various features typically found in a robust task management tool.

## Features

- **Add, Edit, and Delete Tasks:** Easily manage tasks by creating, updating, and removing them as needed.
- **Task Completion Tracking:** Mark tasks as completed and track the overall progress of each project.
- **Due Dates and Urgency:** Assign due dates and urgency levels to tasks and projects to prioritize your workload.
- **Local Storage:** Utilizes the Web Storage API to persist tasks and projects, ensuring your data is saved across sessions.
- **Modular JavaScript:** The project is structured using modular JavaScript, allowing for better code organization and maintainability.
- **OOP Principles (SOLID):** Object-Oriented Programming principles, including SOLID, are implemented to create a scalable and maintainable codebase.
- **DRY Code:** The project emphasizes the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle, reducing redundancy and improving maintainability.
- **Composition Over Inheritance:** The project uses composition over inheritance to create flexible and reusable components.
- **Date Manipulation:** The `date-fns` package is used for effective date handling and manipulation.
